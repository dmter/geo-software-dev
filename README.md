# geo-software-dev
Using the two yml files given I recreated each of the environments with Conda. The commands I used while doing this are in the screenshots. Since my OS is Windows I coukd recreate both of the environments without any issue therefore I did not receive any error messages. I uploaded all the details about the assignment to Visual Studio Code and then pushed it to GitHub. 

You can review the screenshots below for all the details I did in this assignment.

The command I used (the same goes for software_dev_v2.yml):
conda env create -f software_dev_v1.yml --> to create the environment
conda activate software_dev_v1 --> to activate the environment
conda list --> to check the installed packages and validate that installations were successful

conda env create -f software_dev_v2.yml
